got_easy_data
=============

Rails app for easy generation of Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire) data. The data file that I generate will be located in my github repo [game_of_thrones_data](https://github.com/MunkiPhD/game_of_thrones_data)

###Why?!###
As a fan of the series and always looking for data to use in my testing environments that has meaning, I made an app to create the data and release afterwards. No tests, little to no validation - it's a toy app that isn't meant to be released into a production environment!


```
 git clone https://github.com/MunkiPhD/got_easy_data.git
 cd got_easy_data
 bundle install
 rake db:migrate
 rails server
```
**Enjoy!**
